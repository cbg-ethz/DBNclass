#This is script for learning the model with the highest predictive accuracy
#for the dataset GSE5462
#The best model was defined by running parallelized cross-validation for all
#cases of structural and parametric assumptions ("CV_GSE5462_parallel.R")
#the results of CV are in the folder "biological_data_results"
#Both MAP and consensus models are learned
#Non-STRING edges are blacklisted; "bl_125.rds"
#Intra-edges are allowed
#Initial and transition structures are learned separately, i.e. samestruct = FALSE
